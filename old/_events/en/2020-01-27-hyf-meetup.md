This is an informal meetup where everyone interested in OpenStreetMap is welcome to join. Most often we talk about maps, cool uses of them and how to improve them. It is a nice opportunity to get to know the everyone involved and ask questions about anything OpenStreetMap related. Everyone is welcome, from the expert to the newbie that just heard about us.

This meetup is extra special though, as the students of [Hack Your Future](https://hackyourfuture.be/) might join us as well.

Hack Your Future is a four-week project where refugees build a project. This bootcamp is centered around OpenStreetMap and takes place in the Krook. We are invited by them in de Krook.

Note: De Krook closes at 19:00, we might stick around in a nearby pub or restaurant.

We'll (probably) mainly speak English, though we speak Dutch and English as well.
