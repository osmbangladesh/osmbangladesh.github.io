We'll have a usual informal meetup: talk to us about anything related to OpenStreetMap. Total newbie or wondering about how best to do 3D mapping of subway stations? You're guaranteed to learn something new, over a beer or a cup of tea.

Special occasion though: **we will be joined by Allan Mustard**. He is the chair of the Board of Directors of the OpenStreetMap Foundation. The Foundation supports (but doesn't control) the OpenStreetMap project - it keeps the servers running and intervenes when the community runs into trouble. Allan is a recently retired ambassador for the United States, and was elected to the Board at the end of 2019. Chances are Guillaume will also be here (elected in 2019, treasurer) as well as Joost (elected in 2018, secretary).
