**FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate.**

Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Brussels.

We'll meet to have dinner in the city center on Saturday evening (location still to be determined).

We'll also be around the GeoSpatial devroom on Sunday, don't hesitate to ping us!
