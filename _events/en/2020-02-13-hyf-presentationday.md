[Hack Your Future](https://hackyourfuture.be/) is a project where refugees are given a crash course in computer programming work. At the end of their classes, they can participate in a 'bootcamp', where they build a small, meaningful project.

This class will build an application around bivakzones (and possible around social amenities), heavily leaning on OSM. After working on this for four weeks, a small presentation and demo-moment is given. We are invited as well, either to have a look at their cool work and to man an OSM booth.
